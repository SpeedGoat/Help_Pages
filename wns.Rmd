# Weighted Surveillance

<br>

## Introduction

This application provides tools for planning weighted surveillance
sampling for *Pseudogymnoascus destructans* (Pd), the fungal agent that
causes white-nose syndrome in bats, and estimating underlying prevalence
after sampling has been completed.

Weighted surveillance is based on the simple principle that within the
surveillance stream there exists heterogeneity among sample types with
regards to disease risk. To maximize efficiency and potentially increase
the likelihood of detecting new disease foci, weighted surveillance
programs exploit this heterogeneity by focusing disease detection
efforts on sample types most at risk. The underlying methods were
originally developed by [Walsh et al.
(2010)](https://cpw.state.co.us/Documents/Research/WildlifeHealth/Publications/WeightedSurveillanceApproachCWD.pdf)
using a Frequentist statistical approach. These results were then
refined and recast into a Bayesian statistical framework by [Heisey et
al.
(2014)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089843).
It is important to note that the use of weighted surveillance techniques
requires that prior information is available to estimate heterogeneity
in risk and is only useful for disease detection. A general discussion
of weighted surveillance is given in [Walsh et al.
(2012)](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2012/1036/pdf/ofr2012_1036.pdf). When
applying weighted surveillance techniques to Pd detection, the methods
were modified to permit each sample type to have different diagnostic
test sensitivities to align with what is known about variation in
sensitivities.

The first tool called **Design**, is used for planning weighted
surveillance activities. The user specifies how much statistical
confidence they need in the result, the sensitivity of the diagnostic
test in the base-line class (i.e., the sample type defined by the user
against which all other sample types in the surveillance stream are
scaled – in this application the base-line class are winter skin swabs
from *Myotis spp.* and *Perimyotis subflavus*), and what minimum
prevalence they would like to detect in the reference class (e.g., I
would like a 95% confidence of detecting at least one case of Pd if the
prevalence is at least 1%). This information then provides the total
number of points required to meet the specified confidence for the
chosen minimum prevalence. The user can then select from the potential
sources of surveillance samples and vary the number of samples arising
from each source. This provides a means of setting sampling objectives
for each source to ensure the requisite number of points is reached.
This tool can also be used to evaluate in real-time how close a program
is to achieving its goal given the number of samples collected from each
source to date.

The second tool called **Estimation** is for use after sampling for Pd
detection has occurred and no positive cases were found. It provides the
means to estimate the posterior distribution of the potential underlying
prevalence rate of Pd given the number of negative samples collected
during surveillance. Of particular interest is the upper bound of the
95% credible interval, which is the prevalence level for which there is
95% probability that true prevalence is at or below, given the number of
samples tested and lack of any cases detected.

It’s important to note that these tools are entirely independent - you
can use either one however you wish, but there’s no need to use both...
and changes made in one tool won’t have any effect in the other.

The techniques and theory underpinning them used in this application are
described in [Heisey et al.
(2014)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089843).
This application takes advantage of the [R](https://www.R-project.org/)
statistical software for estimation.

## Design Tool

The **Design** tool is used for planning weighted surveillance
activities. If you've already collected your samples and just want to
analyze the results you can skip the design tab and go straight to the
[Estimation tool](#estimation-tool).

To begin using the **Design** tool click on WNS and then Design in the
sidebar.

<img src="./www/weightedsurveil/wns_design.png"/>

<br>

### Design Setup

The setup pane on the Design tab allows you to specify the monitoring
goals of your surveillance program. It includes three sliders which can
be used to set target sampling effort based on the desired outcome.

<img src="./www/weightedsurveil/wns_design_setup.png"/>

1)  Confidence - Use this slider to set the confidence you desire for
    detecting at least one case given the selected prevalence. The
    confidence level can also be thought of as 1 - α.
2)  Design Prevalence - Use this slider to set the minimum target
    prevalence for which you would like the specified confidence of
    detecting at least one case in the reference class (see
    [Points](#points)).
3)  Sensitivity for Winter skin-Myotis - The last slider is used to
    specify the diagnostic test sensitivity, which is assumed to be
    0.975 unless the user changes the value.

<br>

### Points {#points}

While moving the sliders in the input pane you should notice that the
value displayed in the *Target Points* box at the top of the screen
changes.

<img src="./www/weightedsurveil/wns_design_pts.png"/>

The *Target Points* value represents the number of samples you would
need to collect from the reference class in order to achieve the goals
you set in the input tab. Given the example above, you would need 60
samples to achieve 95% confidence of detection given a prevalence rate
of 0.05. Samples from the reference class are always assigned a weight
of 1. Samples from other classes are assigned different weights relative
to the reference class and therefore will contribute more or less to
hitting your target.

<br>

### Effort Data Entry

<img src="./www/weightedsurveil/wns_design_tbl.png"/>

The *Sampling Effort* table displays the Collection Method along with
the weights (relative to the reference class) assigned to each class.
Enter the number of samples you propose to collect for each class in the
last column and the *Points Entered* and *Points Remaining* boxes at the
top of the screen will update. Along with the gauge widget on the right
side, these boxes reflect how the sampling effort you've entered relates
to your monitoring target. You can also explore how the different
collection methods contribute to achieving your monitoring target using
the donut charts at the bottom right of the page.

<br> <br>

## Estimation Tool {#estimation-tool}

The **Estimation** tool is used to estimate the potential underlying
prevalence rate of Pd after sampling has occurred and no positive cases
were found.

To begin using the **Estimation** tool click on WNS and then Estimation
in the sidebar. Then click on *Samples and Diagnostics*.

<br>

### Samples and Diagnostics {#samples-and-diagnostics}

The *Samples and Diagnostics* tab allows you to set different collection
methods and number of samples.

<img src="./www/weightedsurveil/wns_tests.png"/>

The following methods are available for generating a posterior
distribution for diagnostic test characteristics.

1.  The ‘Default’ method uses the posterior distributions of the
    sensitivity and specificity with different sensitivities for each
    sample type. These distributions are based on:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
wns_data <- data.frame(
  `Sample Type` = c("Skin swab", "Environmental swab", "Fecal sample", "Soil", "Pooled environmental guano"),
  `Reference` = c("George and Ballmann (In review)",
                  "George, Lorch, and Ballmann (In review)",
                  "George, Lorch, and Ballmann (In review)",
                  "Verant et al. 2016",
                  "Ballmann et al. (In prep)"),
  check.names = FALSE
)

knitr::kable(wns_data) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = FALSE)
```

2.  The ‘Use data’ method allows the user to specify their results for
    each test, and requires the number of true and false positives and
    negatives. The posterior distributions for the test characteristics
    are then estimated using a Jeffreys prior.

3.  The ‘Quantile’ method allows the user to specify the mean and 95%
    credible bounds for the posterior distribution of the test
    characteristics. These are used to generate a suitable Beta
    distribution.

<img src="./www/weightedsurveil/wns_tests_custom.png"/>

The default method has already been entered for you, so if you plan on
using the default test characteristics for all your samples you can
simply enter the number of samples to collect and click *Add Samples*.
Data you add through these inputs will appear in the *Entered Data*
table to the right. If you make a mistake or change your mind you can
select one or more rows in the table and use the *Delete Selected Rows*
button to remove them from the dataset, or you can *Delete All Rows* to
start over.

<br>

### Model Settings {#model-settings}

You can adjust model settings using the *MCMC* button at the bottom of
the Samples tab. Number of chains, burn-in length, and model iterations
can all be adjusted if needed.

As of writing the priors available to the models are fixed and cannot be
manipulated by the user. You can view these prior distributions by
clicking the *Priors* button.

<br>

### Running a model

When you've entered the appropriate information for each group of
samples collected, checked that everything looks right in the *Samples*
table, and adjusted the model settings if needed, click the *Fit Model*
button to fit a model for your data. After a short time you'll be
prompted with a message letting you know if the model run was
successful. If so a new *Output* tab will appear in the sidebar where
you can view your results.

<br> <br>

## Output Tab

The *Output* tab is only available after you've entered data in the
[Samples tab](#samples-and-diagnostics) and clicked the button to fit a
model.

<br>

### Estimates Table {#estimates-table}

The estimates table displays model outputs (estimated latent prevalence)
for all collection methods in a single table. Mean, median, standard
deviation, and credible intervals (90% and 95%) are reported for each
class. Rows are color coded based on the number of samples entered for
each class.

<img src="./www/weightedsurveil/wns_output_tbl.png"/>

<br>

### Output Plots {#output-plots}

The plots page shows a posterior distribution plot for estimated latent
prevalence of Pd by class, along with diagnostic plots for assessing
model performance. By default, a trace plot depicting every 100th
iteration is displayed, but you can change the plotting interval or
switch to an autocorrelation plot using the button at the top right of
the Diagnostics section.

Change the data displayed in both plots by using the dropdown above the
plots to select a different class. Use the buttons and sliders within
the plots to zoom in to a finer scale or save as an image file. You can
also download density plots for all classes in a single click using the
*Download All* button.

<img src="./www/weightedsurveil/wns_output_plots.png"/>

<br>

### Interpretation {#interpretation}

The interpretation page provides some guidance for explaining the model
output with regard to your actual population. By default the reference
class is displayed, but you can also view an interpretation for a
different class by changing the selection in the dropdown near the top
of the page.

<img src="./www/weightedsurveil/wns_output_interp.png"/>

<br> <br>

### Report

Click the *Download Report* button to generate a full report of your
data. The report includes all of the test and sample data you entered,
the settings used, and the output tables and plots. Reports are
available in html and Microsoft Word formats.

<br> <br>

## Batch Estimation

The batch estimation tool is designed to help users who need to
estimates from many models. The tool has a friendly spreadsheet that may
be downloaded by the user to enter their data and then uploaded to the
site for estimation. To use batch estimation begin by clicking the
*Batch Estimation* link in the sidebar.

### Template

The first step is to download the batch estimation template. The
template is a spreadsheet that can be used to enter data for multiple
models. The template can be downloaded by clicking the *Download
Template* link in the box titled *Upload Data*.

<img src="./www/weightedsurveil/wns_batch_template.png"/>

The template spreadsheet has 4 sheets: *Data*, *Priors*, *Instructions*,
and *Example*. The *Data* sheet is where you will enter your data. The
*Priors* sheet is where you can view the priors that will be used in the
model. The *Instructions* sheet provides guidance on how to use the
template. The *Example* sheet provides an example dataset.

The Data sheet has 7 columns that align with the model’s expectations
and how other aspects of the website function. The first column *Batch*
is used to group samples. Samples with the same value in the *Batch*
column will be estimated together (e.g., all the surveillance samples
from a colony or hibernaculum). The *Species* column is used to specify
the organism for which surveillance is conducted. This should be set to
“Bat”. The *Collection Method* column is used to specify the sample type
(e.g., Winter skin-Myotis). The names for the sample type must align
with those used elsewhere in the application for sample type. The *Age*
and *Sex* columns are used to specify the age and sex of animals
sampled. These should be set to “All Ages” and “All Sexes”. The
*Samples* column is used to specify the number of negative samples
obtained for each collection method. This column allows only whole
numbers greater than or equal to 0. Finally, the *Test* column is used
to specify the diagnostic test to be used. Enter *Default* to use the
default sensitivity or specificity for each sample type. If a custom
test is required then specify that in the website and enter the name of
the test in the *Test* column exactly as it is in the website. For more
information about diagnostic tests see the [Diagnostic
Tests](#diagnostic-tests) section.

Note: when entering data that if any invalid entries are present in your
data when you upload it, the website will issue a warning. Those entries
with invalid entries or those entries for which no prior exists will be
removed prior to running any models.

When the data are entered and you have checked all entries, upload the
spreadsheet by clicking the *Browse...* button and selecting the file
from your computer. Once the file is selected click the *Open* button to
upload the data. The website will check the data and issue a warning if
any invalid entries are present. The data will be shown to the user
under the *Data* tab, while errors will be shown under the *Sample Class
Issues* and *Test Issues* tabs.

### Model Choice

After the data are uploaded the user must select the model to be used
for estimation. The model can be selected by clicking the *Select Model*
dropdown and selecting the desired model. The user can adjust model
settings and MCMC parameters as needed. The settings are the same as
those described in the [Model Settings](#model-settings) section.

<img src="./www/weightedsurveil/cwd_batch_setup.png"/>

### Running a Batch Model

When satisfied that all inputs are correct click the *Fit Model* button
to run the model. The website will run the model and display the results
in a newly created *Output* link in the sidebar on the left. The website
will also display a progress bar to show the user how far along the
model is in the estimation process and notify the user of success or
failure of the model runs.

### Batch Estimation Output

After the model has run the website will display a results table and
report generation option in the *Output* tab located in the sidebar on
the left. Users are encouraged to download the results as a report by
navigating to the Reports tab at the top of their screen and clicking
the *Download Report* button. Reports will delivered as a compressed
file with one report per batch that contains all of the plots and
interpretation users expect from a single model run. For more details on
the outputs see the [Estimates Table](#estimates-table), [Output
Plots](#output-plots), and [Interpretation](#interpretation) sections.
